Description: Efficient calculation of pseudo-ranks. In case of equal sample sizes, pseudo-ranks and mid-ranks are equal. When used for inference mid-ranks may lead to paradoxical results. Pseudo-ranks are in general not affected by such a problem. For details, see Brunner, E., Bathke A. C. and Konietschke, F: Rank- and Pseudo-Rank Procedures in Factorial Designs - Using R and SAS, Springer Verlag, to appear.
